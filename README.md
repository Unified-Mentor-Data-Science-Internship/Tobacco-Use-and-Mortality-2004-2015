# Tobacco Use and Mortality Analysis (2004-2015)

This repository houses the code, data, and documentation for a comprehensive analysis of the intricate relationship between tobacco use and mortality rates in the period spanning 2004 to 2015. This project, undertaken as part of the Unified Mentor Data Science Internship, aims to dissect the multifaceted impact of tobacco consumption on public health, exploring temporal trends, demographic variations, and regional disparities.

**Project Description:**

This project transcends a mere descriptive analysis, venturing into the realm of predictive modeling and statistical inference. It seeks to unravel the complex interplay between tobacco use and mortality by employing a rigorous data science pipeline. The analysis encompasses meticulous data acquisition and cleaning, in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA), strategic feature engineering, robust statistical analysis, and the development and evaluation of predictive machine learning models. The overarching objective is to identify critical determinants of tobacco-related mortality and generate actionable insights that can inform and guide public health policies and interventions.

**In-Depth Objectives:**

* **Comprehensive Data Acquisition and Harmonization:** Gathering and consolidating diverse datasets encompassing tobacco consumption patterns, mortality statistics, socio-economic indicators, and demographic profiles. This involves addressing data heterogeneity, resolving inconsistencies, and ensuring data integrity through meticulous cleaning and transformation.
* **Detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducting a thorough EDA to visualize and interpret the underlying data structure, identify temporal trends, reveal distributional characteristics, and uncover potential correlations between tobacco use and mortality. Employing advanced visualization techniques to illustrate complex relationships and patterns.
* **Strategic Feature Engineering:** Designing and implementing novel features to enhance the predictive power of machine learning models. This includes generating interaction terms to capture synergistic effects, deriving rate-based features to normalize data, and creating categorical variables to represent complex demographic segments.
* **Rigorous Statistical Analysis:** Applying a suite of statistical methodologies to test hypotheses, quantify the strength of associations, and elucidate the underlying mechanisms linking tobacco use and mortality. This includes conducting regression analysis, time-series analysis, and hypothesis testing, while accounting for potential confounding variables.
* **Development and Evaluation of Predictive Models:** Constructing and evaluating a range of machine learning models to predict mortality rates based on tobacco use and associated factors. This includes selecting appropriate algorithms, tuning hyperparameters through cross-validation, and assessing model performance using relevant metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE, R-squared).
* **Data Visualization and Insight Communication:** Crafting compelling visualizations and generating comprehensive reports to effectively communicate the findings to diverse audiences. This involves creating interactive dashboards, producing publication-quality figures, and writing clear and concise summaries of the analysis.

**Key Components and Methodologies:**

* **Automated Data Pipelines:** Implementing robust data pipelines to streamline data acquisition, cleaning, and transformation processes.
* **Interactive Data Visualization Tools:** Utilizing libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to create interactive and informative visualizations.
* **Advanced Statistical Modeling:** Employing statistical techniques such as regression analysis, time-series analysis, and survival analysis to explore relationships and trends.
* **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Implementing and evaluating a range of machine learning models, including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting machines.
* **Model Evaluation and Validation:** Employing rigorous model evaluation techniques, including cross-validation and hold-out validation, to ensure model robustness and generalizability.
* **Comprehensive Documentation:** Providing detailed documentation, including README files, code comments, and project reports, to facilitate reproducibility and understanding.
